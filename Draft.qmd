## Transmission distortion is common

```{r}

# load the manual overview of the crosses in Excel format
Crosses_xlsx<-read_xlsx("~/data/trd/Crosses.xlsx", sheet=2) # should be moved to the github
mean_colonies<-summarize(Crosses_xlsx, mean(`Colonies in pool`, na.rm=TRUE))%>%pull()
sd_colonies<-summarize(Crosses_xlsx, sd(`Colonies in pool`, na.rm=TRUE))%>%pull()
